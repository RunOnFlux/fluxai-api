# Flux AI Components

## Overview

This is a monorepo for Flux AI Components. It includes components to drop right into your NextJS or React project for both FluxGPT (chat) and FluxONE (image).

## Prerequisites

You will need a FluxAI api key and url to use these components, which can be obtained by creating an account on [FluxAI](https://ai.runonflux.com).

Please see the .example.env file for the environment variables you will need to set before starting the project.

Simply add the components and api routes to your project and use them like any other React component.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
